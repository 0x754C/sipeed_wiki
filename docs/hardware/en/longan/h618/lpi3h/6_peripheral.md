## SoC
 
### CPU frequency

```shell
sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
```
Unit: KHz
Note that the system has a temperature control strategy, which will reduce the frequency when the system is too idle or the temperature is too high.

## UART 

### System serial port

The system serial port of the LonganPi 3H is UART0, which is provided in the side pins.  

![uart_pin](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/peripheral/uart_pin.png)  

You can use USB to serial module to connect the serial port, namely `U0-RX` and `U0-TX`, pay attention to cross connection, as well as GND connection (there is also an extra power line in the following picture, if you use typeC port to power, you can not connect this power line).

![uart_connect](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/peripheral/uart_connect.png)  

After the connection is completed, you can use the serial port tool for communication, recommended `XShell` and `mobaterm` under Windows, and `minicom` under Linux.
Set the serial port baud rate to `115200`, and you can log in and operate the commands under the serial terminal:
> Note: After the connection, you can knock several enters to see if there is a response, if there is no response, check the wiring or serial port configuration.


### General serial port

In addition to the system serial port UART0, the device tree also enabled UART1, UART2, UART3, UART4 serial ports by default, which can be used as needed.

#### List serial devices 

```bash
ls /dev/ttyS*
```

#### Viewing serial port information such as baud rate

```bash
stty -F /dev/ttyS1 -a 
```

#### Set serial port baud rate and data mode

```bash
stty -F /dev/ttyS1 ispeed 115200 ospeed 115200 cs8
```

#### Check serial data

```bash
cat /dev/ttyS1
```

#### Sending serial data

```bash
echo "LonganPi3H" > /dev/ttyS1
```

#### Other tools

You can also use `minicom` or pyserial library for serial operation, please find relevant information for yourself.If you want to use unusual baud rate, you can use `picocom`.

## HDMI display

LonganPi 3H supports a display with a maximum resolution of 4k, as shown in the following image:

![hdmi_connect](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/peripheral/hdmi_connect.jpg)

If you don't see anything when you plug in an HDMI display, try changing the display configuration parameters using xrandr from the command line.

First export the DISPLAY variable:
```shell
export DISPLAY=:0.0
```

Then use xrandr to see the available arguments:
```shell
sipeed@lpi3h-ce8e:~$ xrandr                                                     
Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 8192 x 8192

   1920x1080     60.00*+  60.00    59.94

```

Based on the output of the above command, we can try to change the resolution, frame rate and other configurations, such as changing to 1440x900 resolution: 
```shell
xrandr xrandr --output HDMI-1 --mode 1440x900
```
Some parameters may cause the screen to not light up. When you have no display when you plug in an HDMI display, you can use this command to adjust the display parameters to light up, or you can adjust them in the display graphical menu in the system settings.

If you find that you have flickering problems with higher resolutions, try lowering the refresh rate in the graphical settings display menu.

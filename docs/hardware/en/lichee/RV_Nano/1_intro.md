##  Introduction

The LicheeRV Nano is a mini-sized development board (measuring only 22.86*35.56mm), equipped with the SG2002 processor. It features a powerful core running at 1GHz (RISC-V/ARM options available) and a smaller core at 700MHz RISC-V, along with 256MB DDR3 memory, and an integrated 1Tops NPU. The board includes a wealth of interfaces such as MIPI-CSI, MIPI-DSI, SDIO, ETH, USB, SPI, UART, I2C, etc., allowing for the expansion of a wide variety of applications. Its through-hole/half-hole design facilitates easy mass production and soldering.

- Precautions
  - The beta version hardware (70405) NPU only supports operation at 0.5T, running at 1.0T does not guarantee the stability of the board.
  - The WIFI of the beta version hardware (70405) has not been fully optimized yet, resulting in lower speeds. We appreciate your understanding.
  - If purchasing a camera accessory or the WE version package, screws, soldering pillars, and a screwdriver are included in the package. To avoid burns during soldering, please refer to the [Camera & WE Ethernet Module Installation Guide](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/lichee/RV_Nano/2_unbox.html).
  - If purchasing 3-inch, 4-inch, or 10.1-inch screen accessories, a screen adapter board and ribbon cable are included in the package. Please refer to the [Screen Installation Guide](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/lichee/RV_Nano/2_unbox.html)

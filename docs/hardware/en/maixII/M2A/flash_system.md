## Use Serial communication

- Plug in Type C cable into the usb port marked Debug, then you can use serial terminal to control this board

### Linux & macOS

For linux OS, use command `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` to see your device COM number, then use serial application to connect the board.

### Windows

Lichee MaixSense equips with CH340 as serial chip, but we need install its driver to use it.

[Click this](https://api.dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/tools/ch340_ch341_driver) to download the driver for this serial chip, after installing this driver, you can find your device serial port from `Device manager`

## LicheeRV Nano Package Introduction

The LicheeRV Nano is available in four versions based on networking capabilities:

- **Standard Version (B)**: Comes without any networking accessories.
- **Ethernet Version (E)**: Features an onboard 100M Ethernet port for wired network connections.
- **WiFi Version (W)**: Equipped with an onboard WiFi6/BT5.2 module. By default, the BT5.2 functionality is not enabled. To activate Bluetooth capabilities, it's necessary to solder four 0201 resistors in the specified location or use a 2B pencil to create a short circuit in the designated area.

+ The WiFi Ethernet (WE) version features an onboard WiFi 6/BT 5.2 module and comes with an Ethernet module that connects to the development board via standoffs and ribbon cables.

  We also offer the following accessory:

  - Camera![](./../assets/RV_Nano/unbox/Camera.jpg)

+ The camera (model 3754) features non-short-circuiting screw holes on both sides for secure mounting. It is recommended to fix the standoffs to the fifth pad for optimal stability.

  ‚óèSecuring the Standoffs

  1. To avoid burns while soldering the standoffs, you can first screw them onto the Ethernet module.![](./../assets/RV_Nano/unbox/WE3.jpg)

  2.Insert the standoff into the fifth pad. It is advisable to apply solder paste to the pad beforehand to enhance the stability of the standoff after soldering.

## Introduct openwrt

> Allwinnner V831 use Tina Linux, which is created from [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org).

The OpenWrt is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Visit [official-website](https://openwrt.org) and [official open repository](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt) for more details.

For V831 we use adb shell to control it. Connect otg interface marked on board with computer.

- Fow Windows users, download the latest adb, add its path into system path and save it then use command `adb shell` to connect V831.
- For linux we need to install adb first, then run command `adb shell` to connect V831.

## Test screen

- There is a flushing on screen after power on. this means the board is well working, and the flushing is caused by the system reset.

We can use command `cat /dev/urandom > /dev/fb0` to test the screen.

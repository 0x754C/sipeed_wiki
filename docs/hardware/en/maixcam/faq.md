## What's the difference between MaixCAM and LicheeRV-Nano?

MaixCAM can use the resources of LicheeRV-Nano and SG2002, but **LicheeRV-Nano and other SG2002 chip products cannot use software like MaixPy, MaixCDK, MaixVision, etc.** Please do not make a wrong purchase to avoid wasting time and money.

If you want to quickly start developing applications, please choose MaixCAM. If you are a seasoned Linux developer and only want to develop based on the original SG2002 resources, you can choose LicheeRV-Nano.

## Why is there no purchase link in the official Taobao store?

Taobao may close the purchase link when it encounters a shortage of stock. The purchase link will be automatically opened when the stock is available. You can consult the official customer service.
